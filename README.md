lyric-shuffler
==============

A simple html word shuffling tool for lyricists, poets ad designers, or anyone in the brainstorming phase of a creative project. It shuffles and sorts input text into specified numbers of word per line, and lines per verse, or stanza.

This has been kept as simple as possible, so that it is portable and easy to run. Everything is contained in one file, lyric_shuffler.html.

Below are the steps to using this tool:

1. Paste your lyrics or poetry into the left text area.

2. From the dropdown options above the text areas, choose how many words per line, and how many lines per verse, you would like the shuffled output to have.

3. Hit the Shuffle button.

Each time you hit the Shuffle button, the text will be re-shuffled.

Hopefully this tool will help some folks out.
